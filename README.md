============
In my attempt to get better at vim, I am creating this repo to supply my progress and change.
Note, this repo was stolen from https://github.com/irrigger/ir-vim.git as he is the one
getting me to become a vim addict.  Therefore, it was my pleasure to steal his vim
repo and attempt to create my own.

Installation
------------

	cd ~
	git clone https://github.com/irrigger/ir-vim.git .vim
	ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrc
	cd .vim
	git submodule init
	git submodule update

You should now be up and running with my setup.
