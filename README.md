============

In order to get back into vim, I need to organize everything and keep everything easy.

Installation
------------

	cd ~
	git clone https://github.com/munk801/vim-ninja .vim
	ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrc
	cd .vim
	git submodule init
	git submodule update

You should now be up and running with my setup.
