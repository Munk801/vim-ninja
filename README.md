ir-vim
============

My personal Vim setup I've spent the last three years building up.
I tend to work on Linux, Mac, and Windows regularly so I have attempted to
write my vimrc in such a way as to support all three with a single vimrc.

Installation
------------

	cd ~
	git clone https://github.com/irrigger/ir-vim.git .vim
	ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrc
	cd .vim
	git submodule init
	git submodule update

You should now be up and running with my setup.
